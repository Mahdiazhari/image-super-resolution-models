# image-super-resolution-models


Repository based on "SwinIR Online Demo on Real-World Image SR for comparison with BSRGAN (ICCV2021) and Real-ESRGAN".


# Instructions

Open the notebook on colab, it will contain all the instructions and inference codes to start comparison between the algorithms for upscaling: BSRGAN, realESRGAN, and swinIR.

# Results for 4x Manga Upscaling

For 4x manga upscaling, it seems that realESRGAN is the best tradeoff between image quality and image size. The other models output image sizes that are much larger compared to the upscaled manga output of realESRGAN.
